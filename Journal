Orborz Creation Journal
-----------------------

Today I came up with the idea of creating a Unity Game. The Idea consists of being in control of multiple orbs in a puzlle like game, where the player has to get a specific orb into the goal zone while controlling multiple other orbs at the same time. I set up the project using the unity game engine and created the repository. I made a test scene where a sample environment was created and the script for moving the orbs was written. I still need to fix the ball physics.

Today I fixed the physics of the balls and got the movement system and gravity working well. I might need to make some slight tweaks to get the perfect physics behavior that I want.

Updated controls to move one selected ball at a time rather than all the balls at once. The ball to control needs to be selected by clicking. This makes the game easier to play and understand, as well as makes the physics seem more realistic.

Optimized movement. Selected ball was initially set to null, which caused the game to run two extra conditionals to check if the object was null every frame. Created a script to specify the main orb and set that as the initially selected ball by default to eliminate the need for the conditionals to check if the selected ball is null twice every frame. Created a green material to differentiate the main ball from the other balls in the game.

Finished creating goal functionality. The level can now detect when it has been beaten. Imported TextMeshPro shaders to make UI building slightly more simple. Using this, I created the UI that appears when the level is beaten and programmed when it should and shouldn't show up. The UI consists of two buttons for which I created a handler they can call on to access their respective functions. Then the button functionality coding was started. Next I need to make a list of all the levels in the game so the game can keep progressing the player.
