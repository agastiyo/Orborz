Orborz Creation Journal
-----------------------

Today I came up with the idea of creating a Unity Game. The Idea consists of being in control of multiple orbs in a puzlle like game, where the player has to get a specific orb into the goal zone while controlling multiple other orbs at the same time. I set up the project using the unity game engine and created the repository. I made a test scene where a sample environment was created and the script for moving the orbs was written. I still need to fix the ball physics.

Today I fixed the physics of the balls and got the movement system and gravity working well. I might need to make some slight tweaks to get the perfect physics behavior that I want.
